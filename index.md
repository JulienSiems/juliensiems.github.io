## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Freiburg advised by Prof. Frank Hutter. 

After graduating from the University of Freiburg in 2020 with distinction, I was an Applied Science Intern at AWS Berlin working on Neural Network Pruning, I worked on Bayesian Optimization for combinatorial auctions at the University of Zurich, did research into numerical optimization for inverse problems at TU Munich and worked as a Machine Learning Researcher at Merantix Momentum on Interpretable Machine Learning.

## Research Interests
- **In-Context Learning:** State-Space Models, Linear Attention, Linear RNNs
- **Interpretability:** Generalized Additive Models

## News
