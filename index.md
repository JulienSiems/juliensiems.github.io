## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Freiburg supervised by Prof. Frank Hutter. 

After finishing my Masters in Freiburg in 2020, I was an Applied Science Intern at AWS Berlin working on Neural Network Pruning, I worked on Bayesian Optimization for combinatorial auctions at the University of Zurich, did research into numerical optimization for inverse problems at TU Munich and worked as a Machine Learning Researcher at Merantix Momentum on Interpretable Machine Learning.

## Research Interests
- **In-Context Learning:** State-Space Models, Linear Attention
- **Interpretability:** Generalized Additive Models

## News

- **[Jul. 2024]** I co-organized the ELLIS networking event for the new ELLIS Institute Tübingen at ICML 2024 with Jörg Franke.
- **[Mar. 2024]** Our paper "Is Mamba Capable of In-Context Learning?" is accepted at the ICLR 2024 Workshop on Mathematical and Empirical Understanding of Foundation Models (ME-FoMo) and at the AutoML Conference.
- **[Sep. 2023]** Our paper on concurvity (non-linear equivalent of multicollinearity) regularization was accepted at NeurIPS 2023.
- **[Mar. 2023]** Our paper on interpretable reinforcement learning via neural additive models was accepted at the AI4ABM Workshop at ICLR 2023.
- **[Feb. 2023]** We won the Energy Forecasting Challenge on Kaggle organized by Hessian AI.
- **[Nov. 2022]** Our paper on Bayesian Optimization Based Combinatorial Assignment was accepted at AAAI 2023.
