## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Freiburg supervised by Prof. Frank Hutter. 

After finishing my Masters in Freiburg in 2020, I was an Applied Science Intern at AWS Berlin working on Neural Network Pruning, I worked on Bayesian Optimization for combinatorial auctions at the University of Zurich, did research into numerical optimization for inverse problems at TU Munich and worked as a Machine Learning Researcher at Merantix Momentum on Interpretable Machine Learning.

## Research Interests

- **Interpretability:** Generalized Additive Models, Concurvity
- **In-Context Learning:** Mechanistic Interpretability, Prior Data Fitted Networks
